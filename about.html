<h2 class="easttext">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


<div id="faq">
<p class="question" id="q1"> What data is contained in the EAST Retention Database?</p>
<div><p id="a1">This database contains all retention commitments made by EAST retention partners
    as of December 2016. This data was provided by Sustainable Collections Services ®,
    and is, for the most part, the same data as found in GreenGlass, the tool used for
    the original EAST collection analysis. The two exceptions to this are that ConnectNY
    commitments which were extended to EAST are also included, and any changes to
    retentions which were provided to EAST by Retention Partners are also reflected
    in this data.</p></div>

<p class="question" id="q2"> Why did EAST create this database when GreenGlass already exists?</p>
<div><p id="a2">Access to GreenGlass will end in October of 2018, and access requires a login. The data
    in GreenGlass is a static dataset as of October 2016, and while mostly accurate, may contain
    some inaccurate data.   EAST is in the process of exploring various options for providing up to
    date access to the EAST retention commitments for a longer period of time, including maintaining
    a database such as this one.</p></div>

<p class="question" id="q3"> Why did EAST create this database rather than disclosing EAST retention commitments in WorldCat?
    <div><p id="a3">At the present time there is no tool available to disclose EAST retentions in WorldCat.
    Once a tool to register retention commitments in OCLC is available EAST will explore this option.
    In the meantime the EAST Project Team felt it was important to explore all options.</p></div>

<p class="question" id="q4"> Can I make changes directly to this data?</p>
<div><p id="a4">Not at this time.  However you can request that changes be made by emailing the
    EAST Data Librarian Sara Amato at samato@blc.org.   Please note that any changes to EAST
    retention commitments must be in accordance with the
    <a href="https://eastlibraries.org/policies-mou">EAST Major Operating Policies</a>.</p></div>

<p class="question" id="q5"> Can this database tell me who holds at title in EAST?</p>
<div><p id="a5">No, this database only contains retentions, not full print holdings.  If you
    need to determine who else holds a title, please use
    <a href="http://greenglass.sustainablecollections.com/">GreenGlass</a> or
    <a href="https://www.worldcat.org">WorldCat</a>.</p></div>

<p class="question" id="q6"> Did you know that diacritics aren’t working?</p>
<div><p id="a6">Yes, we are aware of the display issues with diacritics.   If it is determined that this database
    will be used on an ongoing basis an effort will be made to fix this issue.</p></div>

<p class="question" id="q7"> Why do some titles sort out of order?</p>
<div><p id="a7">The data provided to us for this databases has the full 245 (subfields a, b & c) in the titles.
    While titles generally sort in order, this occasionally causes problems such as the example below:
    <blockquote>
    <i>The diary of a chambermaid : a naughty French novel / Octave Mirbeau.</i><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorts before<br />
    <i>The diary of a chambermaid / Octave Mirbeau</i><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as “a naughty” comes before “Octave” .
    </blockquote>
    </p></div>

<p class="question" id="q8"> Can I get a copy of the raw data used to build this database?</p>
<div><p id="a8">By all means.  You can request a copy of the raw data by completing this form:
    https://goo.gl/AqCPyO .</p></div>

<p class="question" id="q9"> I have feedback or more questions!</p>
<div><p id="a9">Please direct any feedback or additional questions to Sara Amato - samato@blc.org.</p></div>
